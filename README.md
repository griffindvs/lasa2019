# [LASA 2019](https://lasa2019.com)
Developed by [Griffin Davis](https://griffindvs.com) for the [LASA](http://lasahighschool.org) Class of 2019.

This project uses HTML along with CSS built with Sass on the [Bootstrap 4.0](https://getbootstrap.com/) component library. It is hosted with [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). New pages for upcoming events, such as Prom or AP testing, can be added with a new HTML file using `<head>`, `<nav>`, and other various elements from other pages, exluding `index.html`.

All changes that are submitted will be reviewed by [Griffin](https://griffindvs.com) before being added to the site. Please view the suggestions below if you would like to contribute.
