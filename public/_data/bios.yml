  role: President
  bio: Hey seniors! I’m Lisa and I’m the President of the Class of 2019! My favorite thing about StuCo is probably prom because it’s like my baby, but I also appreciate the time we spend on hoco, socials, and other random activities, as well as getting to be in on what goes on at LASA. Outside of that, I spend my hours swimming for LBJ (go pool jags!), at Austin Swim Club, and spending time with my family and friends.

  role: Vice President
  bio: My name is Hannah and I’m the VP of the Class of 2019! I love swimming and yearbooking and whatever the verb is for doing SciO! My favorite part of being on StuCo is the fact that I get to meet my class and I’m so fortunate to do what I do.
